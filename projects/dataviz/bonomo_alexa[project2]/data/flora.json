    "Quote": "They passed over the tumbled stones, and began to climb; for Amon Rȗdh stood upon the eastern edge of the high moorlands that rose between the vales of Sirion and Narog, and even above the stony heath at its base its crown was reared up a thousand feet and more. Upon the eastern side a broken land climbed slowly up to the high ridges among knots of birch and rowan, and ancient thorn-trees rooted in rock. Beyond, upon the moors and about the lower slopes of Amon Rȗdh there grew thickets of aeglos; but its steep grey head was bare, save for the red seregon that mantled the stone. (CoH VII)",
    "Significance": "As the petty-dwarf, Mȋm, led Túrin and his outlaw band to his dwelling on Amon Rȗdh (the vegetation of which is described in the preceding quote from the Children of Húrin), they came to steeper ground (Figure 7.1) and “passed under the shadows of ancient rowan-trees, into aisles of long-legged aeglos: a gloom filled with a sweet scent” (CoH VII). Then they encountered a rock wall, but, turning to the right and following a narrow path, Túrin saw a cleft in the wall, shrouded by trailing plants: the hidden opening to Mȋm’s home (which was soon to become Túrin’s). The description of the plants of Amon Rȗdh is extremely detailed, and aeglos is one of the more intriguing. It is not a pleasant plant, this relative of gorse (Ulex europaeus; see UT 1: II, note 14); the gloom of its shade, along with its numerous, branched, and sharply pointed thorns, is off-putting, perhaps even ominous, and is counterbalanced only by its fragrant, white flowers. Aeglos (meaning snow-thorn) was later the name of the spear of Gil-galad, so perhaps we see in this name a foreshadowing of Túrin’s bravery in his soon-to-intensify struggle against Morgoth. The mountain is capped by another, more mysterious plant, seregon, with its blood-red flowers adding to the sense of foreboding (see seregon, Sedum sp.). Amon Rȗdh is a focal point in the story of Turin, and it is clear that Tolkien thought that it needed to be carefully described—and its plants are an important part of this description. Their mention is far from mere descriptive detail, and although the placement of these plants on this mountain is ecologically appropriate, neither do they simply contribute to the veracity of Middle-earth. Plants such as aeglos and seregon contribute to the mood and give the reader a clearer understanding of the unfolding narrative theme. When the reader understands aeglos and seregon, we better understand the tragic life of Túrin. We don’t expect, in the end, much good to come from Túrin’s new home.\n﻿Gorse (or whin, Ulex europaeus) is a very similar plant to aeglos but has yellow flowers instead of white ones. It is mentioned only twice in The Lord of the Rings, the first encounter (using the name whin) takes place along the road from the Gates of Moria, shortly before the Company saw Durin’s Stone, and the second (using the more commonly applied name gorse) is when Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, climb up a ridge in northern Ithilien, and, at this occurrence, the plant is given a surprisingly detailed description: “The gorse-bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them, passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould” (LotR 4: VII). It grew among thorn trees (Crataegus spp.), whortleberry (Vaccinium myrtillus and/or V. uliginosum), and brambles (Rubus spp., especially those of the R. fruticosus complex). It is in this spot that the hobbits found a sheltered hollow where they spent the night—not the most pleasant location since both gorse and thorn trees have sharp-pointed branches (thorns) and brambles have sharp-pointed, straight to curved hairs (prickles).",
    "Entymology": "According to the index of Unfinished Tales, aeglos is Sindarin for “snow-thorn,” and in The Silmarillion the name is glossed as “snow-point.” The meaning of both names clearly is the same since thorns are modified, sharply pointed branches. The English common name “gorse” is derived from Old English gors, derived through Proto-Germanic *gorst-1 from Proto-Indo-European *ghers- (meaning prickly or bristly). The common name “whin” is less commonly used and is derived from the Middle English whynne, which comes from the Old Norse hvein (meaning gorse). The scientific name Ulex is derived from the ancient Latin name for the plant (or perhaps some other similar species).",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Aeglos, it seems, only grew in the vicinity of Amon Rȗdh in western Beleriand, although it is undoubtedly related to furze or gorse (Ulex europeaus), from which it differed in its larger stature and white (not yellow) flowers. Gorse is widespread in Europe and also grows in northwestern Africa; it has been introduced (and is an invasive, weedy shrub) in parts of western North America, southern South America, Jamaica, and Australia. Gorse was probably also widely distributed in the Middle-earth of the Third Age since we know that it grew just west of the Misty Mountains near the Drimrill Dale and also in Ithilien. Both gorse and aeglos are thorny shrubs, with fragrant, bee-pollinated flowers and explosively dehiscent fruits. Gorse and presumably also aeglos occur in open grassy areas, moors, heaths, open rocky and grassy slopes, and montane thickets.",
    "Economic_Uses": "The flowers of gorse are edible (used in salads), and the leaves provide fodder for livestock. They are attractive shrubs and are thus also used horticulturally (but in some places have become problematic ecologically due to their ability to naturalize). The wood of gorse is very flammable and can be used to start fires.",
    "Description": "Erect shrub, the branches, at least when young, green, ridged, and sharply pointed at the apices (i.e., forming thorns). Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, simple (but compound, with three leaflets in seedlings), very narrowly ovate to linear, with a single midvein, other veins obscure; the apex acute and spinose, the base broad, the margin entire, both surfaces with simple hairs; stipules absent. Flowers solitary, stalked and in the axils of small leaves, each associated with two small bracts, bilaterally symmetrical, bisexual, and very fragrant; the sepals five, fused into two parts, the upper minutely two-toothed, the lower minutely three-toothed, these pale green, hairy; the petals white (in aeglos; yellow in gorse), modified, the uppermost forming the standard and positioned on the outside in bud; the two lateral forming the wings and the two lowermost fused, forming the keel; the corolla thus like a pea-flower; the stamens 10, fused into a tubel and the single carpel elongated, with a curved style; ovary superior. Fruit an explosively dehiscent, hairy legume (Figure 7.1)",

    "Quote": "After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon bordered with leaning alder-trees. (LotR 1: III)",
    "Significance": "Alders nearly always grow near water, and this close association is stressed in nearly every one of J. R. R. Tolkien’s references to these common trees or shrubs (as in the preceding quote) and is also shown in Tolkien’s watercolor painting Alder by a Stream (see fig. 7 in W. G. Hammond and C. Scull’s, 1995, J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator). Furthermore, a person can easily get lost in alder thickets, which are unpleasant because one almost always has wet feet after hiking through them. Thus, it is not surprising that alder habitats early acquired a reputation as hideouts or places of danger. This sinister reputation is echoed in The Silmarillion, in the scene in which Beren reaches the site of his father’s death and “as he drew near the carrion-birds rose from the ground and sat in the alder-trees beside Tarn Aeluin, and croaked in mockery” (SILM 19) (see Figure 7.2). Alnus glutinosa, the only species to occur natively in Great Britain, has the common name of black alder and is clearly referenced by Tom Bombadil when he tells the four hobbits to “Fear no alder black!” (LOTR 1: VI). And certainly many of Tom’s adventures had taken place along the Withywindle, among reeds (Phragmites australis), willows (Salix alba, and relatives), and “under leaning alder” (TATB, “Bombadil Goes Boating,” line 22). Other common species of the Northern Hemisphere include green alder (A. alnobetula), grey or speckled alder (A. incana), red alder (A. rubra), smooth alder (A. serrulata), and white alder (A. rhombifolia).",
    "Entymology": "The English name “alder” is derived from the Old English alor. The related Latin name, Alnus, is the classical name for this plant, which may have been derived from the verb alo (to nourish), an allusion to the habitats of these shrubs or trees, which are closely associated with water. Alternatively, the name could go back to the Proto-Indo-European *el- meaning red or brown, a possible reference to the wood, which, when cut, is initially white and then turns red. The name in Quenya may be ulwë or uluswë.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Alders, a group of some 30 species, are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and also extend into South America along the Andes. China and Japan have the highest diversity (ca. 17 species). They are sun-loving plants and almost always grow in wet habitats, occurring, for example, in swamps, along streams, on wet floodplains, and in bogs or muskegs. They are ecologically significant in that the root nodules contain symbiotic bacteria (Frankia) that convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by plants. This nitrogen is transported to the leaves, which, when dropped, enrich the soil. The species are differentiated by characters such as the form of the winter buds, leaf shape, form of the apex, and marginal condition, and whether the carpellate catkins are clustered or solitary. The plants are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are dispersed by wind or water.",
    "Economic_Uses": "The wood, when submerged, is rot resistant and thus has been used in pilings (e.g., much of Venice was originally built on alder pilings). The wood also is used in barrels, furniture, is prized in electric guitars, and makes good charcoal. The cone-like fruiting clusters occasionally are used in dried floral arrangements.",
    "Description": "Deciduous trees and shrubs, the bark smooth to scaly, with circular to horizontally elliptic lenticels; the roots with nitrogen-fixing nodules. Leaves alternate, simple, ovate to ± elliptic, pinnately veined, with secondary veins running into the teeth, the apex acute or obtuse to slightly acuminate, the base cuneate or acute to slightly cordate, the margin usually double serrate (i.e., with small and large teeth), with simple, straight to crisped hairs and minute, gland-headed hairs, petiolate, with well-developed stipules. Flowers inconspicuous, unisexual (and both staminate and carpellate flowers on each plant), usually blooming in spring before or as the leaves emerge; the staminate flowers in elongate, dangling catkins, with usually four tiny perianth parts, these slightly fused, and usually four stamens; the carpellate flowers in erect catkins that become ovoid to ellipsoid and cone-like at maturity due to their persistent bracts, with perianth lacking and two fused carpels; the styles two, reddish or purple, and ovary nude (inferior). Fruit small, slightly flattened, a nutlet or samara (Figure 7.2).",

    "Quote": "And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin\nIn the green fields of Lebennin. (LotR 5: IX)",
    "Significance": "This species has long been a source of confusion to readers of The Lord of the Rings. It is sometimes considered to be the same plant as simbelmynë (or evermind, uilos), which grew on the burial mounds of the kings of Rohan and also at Amon Anwar, where Elendil was once buried. The name alfirin is used for both species—for simbelmynë, which has more or less erect, starlike, white flowers (see entry for Evermind), and also the plant considered here, which has nodding, long-lasting, bell-shaped, golden-yellow flowers, and is mentioned in Legolas’s poem describing the “green fields of Lebennin” that he recited to Merry and Pippin in Minas Tirith (see preceding quote and Figure 7.3). These descriptions are so different, however, that it seems unlikely that they can refer to the same plant, as noted by both Christopher Tolkien (see Unfinished Tales, in footnote 38 to “Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan”) and W. G. Hammond and C. Scull (The Lord of the Rings: A Reader’s Companion, 2005, pp. 397–398). We agree and consider alfirin, as described in Legolas’s poem, to be a species distinct from simbelmynë. Yet, the question remains, what sort of plant is this alfirin? Among the European wildflowers, the most likely possibility, in our opinion, is that it is a yellow-flowered species of fritillary (i.e., a member of the genus Fritillaria, a group of lilylike plants that arise from bulbs and occur commonly in open habitats in Europe). These plants have nodding, bell-like flowers, and they often grow in grass-dominated habitats, fitting the ecological setting of Legolas’s poem—in “green fields” (LotR 5: IX). Lebennin had a southern European climate, and it is interesting that several bright yellow species of Fritillaria grow in Greece (e.g., F. conica, F. euboeica) and Turkey (e.g., F. aurea, F. carica). These plants perfectly fit the description and ecological setting provided in Legolas’s poem. A final, and related, problem concerns the identity of mallos. This name also is Sindarin, and means “golden-flower.” Is this merely another name for alfirin, or is it a different plant? The use of both names in the poem supports the latter, and we suggest that perhaps mallos represents yet another yellow-flowered species of Fritillaria. This is a distinct possibility since several yellow-flowered species occur in this genus and in addition to those just listed (e.g., Fritillaria pudica, a western North American species; F. crassicaulis, a Chinese species; and the yellow variants of F. imperialis, a widely cultivated species that is native from Turkey and Iraq eastward across Iran and extending into the western Himalayas). Another genus of Liliaceae that potentially matches the brief description of alfirin is Erythronium, a group of 27 species of woodlands, montane meadows and prairies species that grows in North America and Eurasia. They have more strongly reflexed petals than the flowers of Fritillaria (as shown in the lower flower in the illustration) and may have white, yellow, pink, or violet tepals.",
    "Entymology": "The Sindarin name alfirin is derived from al- (not) and firin (mortal) and thus means immortal (see Parma Eldalamberon 17, by David Giraudeau), although why the plant receives this name is not entirely clear. In a letter to Amy Ronald (Letters: No. 312) J. R. R. Tolkien compared it with an immortelle (i.e., members of the genus Helichrysum, in the plant family Asteraceae, which have dry, papery, and thus long-lasting flowers when picked). Thus, the name may relate to the fact that alfirin was envisioned by Tolkien as a plant with very long-lasting flowers. He specifically noted that the flowers of alfirin should not be thought of as “dry and papery,” and his description of the plant as having “golden bells” also does not at all agree with those of Helichrysum, which has tiny flowers in involucrate heads. It thus seems that only the concept of long-lasting flowers and the name immortelle are taken from Helichrysum, while the morphology of the plant itself agrees much more with that of a petaloid monocot, such as Fritillaria or Erythronium. The scientific name Fritillaria comes from the Latin fritillus, meaning dice box, and is a reference to the checkered pattern of the perianth parts (i.e., tepals) of many species of this genus.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Fritillaries or mission bells (members of the large genus Fritillaria, with ca. 130 species) are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere but are most diverse in the Mediterranean region, southwestern and central Asia, and western North America. Twenty-three species occur in Europe, 31 in Turkey (and eastern Aegean Islands), 24 species in China, and 20 in North America. They are characteristic of open habitats such as alpine and subalpine meadows, pastures, various grasslands, open woods and scrub, rocky places, and scree slopes. Species can be distinguished by characteristics such as form of the bulb scales; leaf size and arrangement; inflorescence structure; the shape, size, and orientation of the flowers; color of the tepals (yellow, orange, pink, red, pale to dark purple, brown, green, white, often with alternating squares of dark and light color); form of the nectar glands (on the tepals); floral fragrance (pleasant to quite unpleasant, or without an odor); length of the anther filaments; extent of style branching; and presence or absence of wings on the capsules. The showy flowers attract a variety of pollinators, such as birds, wasps, bumblebees, and flies. The flattened seeds may be wind dispersed.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Some species of Fritillaria (fritillaries, mission-bells), such as F. imperialis, F. meleagris, and F. persica are popular garden ornamentals because of their large, colorful flowers, but many species, although beautiful, are difficult to grow (or are unknown in cultivation, having unknown horticultural characteristics). Many are quite poisonous, containing various alkaloids, and a few are of medicinal value.",
    "Description": "Perennial herbs, arising from scaly bulbs, these short and erect; the flowering stem erect, cylindrical; roots contractile, pulling the bulb deeper into the soil. Leaves alternate, opposite, or whorled, basal, or distributed along the stem, simple, linear to ovate, with parallel veins, the apex acute, the base broad, petiolate or not, the margin entire, glabrous to papillose-hairy; stipules absent. Inflorescences terminal, few to several flowered racemes, these occasionally umbel-like, with leaflike bracts, sometimes reduced to a solitary flower. Flowers radially symmetrical, usually pendent, fairly large, yellow (or in related species, orange, pink, red, pale to dark purple, brown, green, white, often with alternating squares of dark and light color), odorless to strongly fragrant (and then pleasant to very unpleasant), with a perianth of six tepals, these distinct, ovate to obovate, apically acute to obtuse, with three outer and three inner ones, arranged in bell-shaped manner, and with each tepal apically curved outward to more or less straight, and each with a basal nectar-producing region, but this better developed in the three inner ones. Stamens six, hidden within the perianth, with conspicuous, flexible anthers (attached to the filament at one end to near middle). Carpels three, fused, the style single or three-branched; ovary superior. Fruit a six-angled, sometimes six-winged capsule; seeds yellow to brown, flattened (Figure 7.3).",

    "Quote": "About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep. (LotR 4: VII)",
    "Significance": "Anemones were seen by Sam and Frodo in Ithilien (Figure 7.4). They were first encountered shortly before they camped for the day by a small lake (and Sam stewed rabbits), and at this locality they grew with primeroles (Primula spp.) in filbert brakes (thickets of Corylus maxima); later, they were seen on their journey to the cross-roads, where they occurred in open, grassy areas with celandine (possibly Ranunculus ficaria, but more likely Chelidonium majus). These spring wildflowers, among many others growing in Ithilien, lifted the spirits of the two hobbits. As J. R. R. Tolkien (in his role as narrator) comments, “Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now desolate kept still a disheveled dryad loveliness” (LotR 4: IV). The anemones are described as being white and blue (see quote), and it is likely, therefore, that this represents a mixed occurrence, possibly of the wood anemone (A. nemorosa, which usually has white flowers, flushed with pink or purple beneath, and is widely distributed in Europe) and the blue anemone (A. apennina, which has blue flowers and is widespread in southern Europe). The former grows natively in England, while the latter is commonly cultivated there and sometimes naturalizes.",
    "Entymology": "The English name “anemone” and the scientific generic name Anemone are derived from the classical Latin anemone and the Greek anemone, which means wind-flower (literally, “daughter of the wind”; from anemos, wind). The early American systematist, Asa Gray, suggested that this derivation is based on the mistaken idea that these flowers open only when the wind blows, but another possible link to wind is seen in their small, dry fruits, which are often plumose and thus wind-dispersed. However, many have doubted this etymological derivation, suggesting instead that the early Greeks borrowed the name from that of the Semitic deity Naaman (= Adonis), whose worship was associated with these flowers (said by Ovid in his Metamorphoses to have sprung from the blood of Adonis).",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Anemone is a genus of about 150 species (of these, 25 occur in North America, north of Mexico; 17 grow in Europe; and more than 50 occur in China), and the group is broadly distributed, especially in temperate and arctic regions. Anemones occur in a variety of habitats, such as dry to wet meadows or prairies, lakeshores, streamsides, swamps, open to deep deciduous to mixed-coniferous woodlands, rocky slopes, and alpine meadows. Species distinctions are often difficult and based on characters such as whether or not the plant produces rhizomes or tubers; leaf form (simple or compound, extent of lobing or dissection); inflorescence structure and form of the associated bracts; number, shape, and color of the tepals; number of stamens; the length of the persistent style in fruit; whether or not it is persistently hairy; size and shape of the achene; length of associated hairs; and extent of wing development. The showy flowers are pollinated by various insects; the small, dry fruits are often associated with hairs or have a persistent hairy style and thus are dispersed by wind; some may be ant-dispersed.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Several species of anemone are cultivated as ornamentals because of their beautiful flowers, which may be yellow, white to red, or blue. The plants are poisonous, as is typical of members of Ranunculaceae, containing the lactone glycoside ranunculin.",
    "Description": "Perennial herbs, sometimes producing rhizomes or tubers; hairs, when present, simple; stems erect or very short. Leaves usually alternate (but leaflike bracts below the inflorescence may be opposite), more or less basal, one to numerous, simple or compound, often lobed or dissected, with palmate venation; the apex acute or acuminate to obtuse; the margin entire, serrate or crenate, petiolate; stipules absent. Inflorescences terminal, few-flowered cymes, umbels, or reduced to a solitary flower and with leaflike to sepal-like, opposite or whorled bracts, these often appearing to be in tiers and positioned close to or distant from the flowers. Flowers radially symmetrical, bisexual, erect to nodding, usually with a perianth of tepals; these distinct, four to numerous, and white to red, blue, purple, green, or yellow; usually 10 to numerous stamens, these distinct; carpels numerous, distinct, the ovaries superior. Fruits a cluster of achenes, often associated with a tuft of elongate hairs, each with persistent, short to elongated and sometimes hairy style (Figure 7.4).",

    "Quote": "Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. “Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting,” he said. “But I reckon I’ll miss them both before long.” (LotR 1: XI)",
    "Significance": "Orchard apples (Malus domestica) were widely cultivated in the Middle-earth of the Third Age, as they are across the Northern Hemisphere today, although they must have been introduced there because they likely were originally restricted to a forested region east of the Sea of Rhûn (being native to Kazakhstan and surrounding regions, today). Apples are first mentioned (i.e., “Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe” LotR 1: III) in Bilbo’s walking song, sung by the hobbits on their first full day of hiking through the Shire on their way to Crickhollow (Figure 7.5). This is likely a reference to the wild apple (or crabapple, Malus sylvestris), which was common in the hedgerows of the Shire. That evening, they encountered elves in the Woodyend, where they were served fruits “richer than the tended fruits of gardens” and were overwhelmed by the beauty of elven singing. Although he could never afterward fully describe it, that night remained etched in Sam’s memory, and he would say “if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean” (LotR 1: III). Clearly, the elves had shared their orchard apples, among other fruits, with the hobbits, and perhaps the elves, during their original migrations, had carried the species with them as they had moved westward across Middle-earth, starting from Cuiviénen on the shore of a great inland sea. Orchard apples, as an important cultivated fruit, were prized also by the entwives and are mentioned in the elvish song describing their estrangement from the ents. Although the ents loved the great trees of the wild woods, the entwives “gave their minds to the lesser trees … and they saw the sloe [Prunus spinosa] in the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry [Prunus spp.] blossoming in spring” (LotR 3: IV). The “wild apple” referenced here, like the earlier one, is the European crabapple (Malus sylvestris), a species native to Europe that produces small, astringent fruits and has interbred with orchard apples, enriching their genome. The entwives ordered these trees—undoubtedly including both apples and crabapples—“to grow according to their wishes”—thus creating orchards and gardens, and, as a result, they slowly became estranged from the ents, who by this time lived far away, in pristine wilderness such as Fangorn. Finally, apples were appreciated by the human inhabitants of Gondor (and likely others regions as well). Beregond and Pippin were provided from the storehouse of the former’s Company of the Guard “bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of the winter store, wrinkled but sound and sweet” (LotR 5: I) shortly after Pippin had been sworn to the service of the Lord Denethor and the city of Gondor. According to Treebeard, humans learned many agricultural crafts from the entwives, so perhaps the entwives had passed on their knowledge of grafting, an essential skill in the cultivation and maintenance of desirable apple cultivars. Apple cultivars are not mentioned by name in The Lord of the Rings, but we are sure that the hobbits encountered a flavorful array of different kinds of apples as they traveled from the Shire to Gondor, just as there are many cultivated varieties of apples today. But apples could be put to other purposes—and as Strider was leading the hobbits out of Bree, Sam found one such use. Before leaving, he had filled his pocket with apples and was enjoying one when he (and companions) were insulted by Bill Ferny near the town’s outskirts. Sam had had enough, especially when Bill Ferny implied that Sam would ill-treat their recently purchased pony. Sam turned quickly and, with a sudden flick, hit Bill right in the nose. As they walked on Sam noted—“Waste of a good apple” (LotR 1: XI)!",
    "Entymology": "The English word “apple” comes from Old English æppel (apple, any kind of fruit, except for berries), and the use of apple as a general fruit term existed as late as the seventeenth century. The Old English word may have been derived from the Proto-Germanic *ap(a)laz, and from Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l- (original sense uncertain). The scientific generic name Malus is derived from the classical Latin malum (apple); note that when pronounced with a long “a” the word is the Roman name for apple, but when pronounced with a short “a,” the word means bad or wicked. The Latin malum (apple) is derived from the ancient Greek malon or melon (fruit tree). The Sindarin name for apple is cordof and possibly also orf. Orforn has been suggested as meaning apple tree. The Quenya name may be orva.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Apples (members of the genus Malus) are distributed broadly in the Northern Hemisphere; the group is in need of systematic study, and species limits, especially, are unclear, with some scientists recognizing as many as 55 species. Ten species are native or naturalized in North America (the most widespread of which are the western crabapple, M. ioensis; the southern crabapple, M. angustifolia; and American or sweet crabapple, M. coronaria); six species occur in Europe, and the most widespread of these is the European crabapple (M. sylvestris). Eastern Asia is the region of highest diversity of apples, with about 28 species. Species are distinguished by characteristics relating to the leaf shape, pubescence, and margin (e.g., lobed or not, form of marginal teeth); shape, pubescence, and persistence of the sepals; color of the anthers; the number and pubescence of the styles; and size and coloration of the fruit. The orchard apple (M. domestica; also sometimes called M. pumila) originated in central Asia, in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and adjacent China, where wild populations still occur (and are often identified as M. sieversii, although recent DNA evidence indicates that this should be considered conspecific with the orchard apple). Orchard apples likely were first domesticated in the Tian Shan Mountains and were then carried along the Silk Road, appearing in the Middle East about 4,000 years ago. They were later carried into Europe by the Greeks and Romans, and, by this time, grafting was already an important technique in their propagation (allowing maintenance of desirable cultivars since sexual reproduction in apples results in offspring that may have fruit characteristics very different from those of the female parent). While cultivated in Europe, orchard apples crossed with the native European crabapple (M. sylvestris), and evidence of these hybridization events remains in the apple genome (e.g., the ‘Granny Smith’ cultivar has the chloroplast genome of the European crabapple). The showy flowers open in the spring, before the emergence of the leaves, and they are pollinated by bees and flies; the small fruits characteristic of most species are dispersed by birds, but the large fruits of the wild populations of the orchard apple are eaten and dispersed by bears.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Orchard apples (M. domestica) are the most important temperate fruit tree in the world and the fourth most important fruit in the world (after citrus, grapes, and bananas) in terms of economic production; more than 7,500 cultivars are known, and the large, green, yellow, or red fruits, quite variable in flavor, are eaten raw, cooked, or used to make cider (in the case of astringent cultivars, some of which is processed to form vinegar). Apples have moderate levels of a large number of nutrients. Apple wood (often from M. sylvestris, the European crab apple) is used for furniture, mallet heads, croquet balls, tool handles, and smoking meats. Finally, various species of Malus are used as ornamental trees because of their showy flowers and colorful fruits.",
    "Description": "Deciduous trees or shrubs, the bark brown to gray, eventually forming longitudinal and transverse fissures, thus forming plates or scales; the branches forming long and short shoots (and the latter often forming thorns), with or without simple hairs. Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, simple, ovate to obovate, pinnately veined, with secondary veins forming loops or running into the apices of the lobes; the apex acute or acuminate to rounded, the base cuneate or acute to slightly cordate, the margin clearly to obscurely serrate, double serrate, crenate, or occasionally nearly entire, sometimes also ± lobed, usually with simple, nonglandular hairs, petiolate; stipules present, usually deciduous. Inflorescences terminal, few to several-flowered cymes. Flowers radially symmetrical, bisexual, the sepals five, triangular; the petals five, basally narrowed, white to red; and the stamens numerous, with anthers globose, yellow or rose to purple, all borne on a nectar-producing cup (= hypanthium) with 3–5 fused carpels; the styles 3–5, the ovary inferior. Fruit small to large pomes; these globose or depressed-globose, obovoid, or oblong, green, yellow, or red to orange-red, with the flesh of most species lacking stone cells (Figure 7.5).",

    "Quote": "Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered hands and long legs. (LotR 3: IV)",
    "Significance": "Ash trees are common in Middle-earth. They are frequently tall, with straight, gray-barked trunks, and their leaves are distinctive, being opposite and pinnately compound, with usually 5–11 leaflets arranged featherlike along the sides of the axis. These characteristics are reflected in the description (quoted here) of the ashlike ents seen by Merry and Pippin in Fangorn forest. It is thus not surprising that Aragorn and his companions observed the riders of Rohan carrying “tall spears of ash” (LotR 3: II; see also Figure 7.6) since its light yet strong wood was once the material of choice for such implements (and is still widely used in tool handles and sporting implements). The wood’s elasticity makes it a good choice for walking sticks—and we know, thanks to Háma’s observation, that Gandalf carried an ash staff as he entered, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, the hall of Théoden in Edoras. Many times we see Gandalf’s power reflected in his staff, as when (after his fall in Moria, revealing his white garments), he lifted up his staff and Gimli’s axe “leaped from his grasp” and Aragorn’s sword “blazed with a sudden fire” (LotR 3: V) during his encounter with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in Fangorn. Wood must have great strength to channel such power, and this gives us a fresh appreciation for the ash.",
    "Entymology": "The English name, “ash,” was derived through Old English, æsc, from the Germanic *askaz or *askiz. Interestingly æsc can mean ash tree or a spear made of ash wood since ash was the preferred source of wood for spear shafts. The Latin name, Fraxinus, is the classical name for this tree, and, interestingly, it can also mean a spear or javelin made from ash wood. The Sindarin name of these trees is lith.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Ashes belong to the genus Fraxinus, a group of 49 species distributed broadly across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, although a few extend into the American tropics; 24 species occur in North America, while 4 occur in Europe, 16 in China, and 7 in Japan. The European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is the most widespread and common species in Mediterranean region, although the narrow-leaved ash (F. angustifolia) is also common, while white ash (F. americana), pop ash (F. caroliniana), black ash (F. nigra), green ash (F. pennsylvanica), and blue ash (F. quadrangulata) are common in eastern North America. The most widespread western North American species include California ash (F. dipetala), Oregon ash (F. latifolia), and velvet ash (F. velutina). Numerous species also occur in eastern Asia. Floral form and fruit shape (especially the form of the wing) are very useful in distinguishing these species. Ashes occur in a wide variety of forested habitats, from swamps to arid uplands. Ashes are usually wind-pollinated, but a few species have showy white flowers (with two or four petals), attracting generalist insect pollinators, and their winged fruits are wind-dispersed. In North America, sadly, many ash trees are dying due to attack by a beetle, the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) recently introduced from eastern Asia; many European ashes also are under attack by the an ascomycete fungus (Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus), likely also introduced from Asia.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Ash trees are important ornamentals, and they are thus valuable in urban forestry. Ashes provide a strong, fairly lightweight, yet elastic wood; they are therefore a popular source for tool handles, wooden sporting equipment, or weapons: bats, tennis racquets, billiard cues, hockey sticks, walking sticks, snowshoes, canoe paddles, bows, or spears. The wood is prized in making furniture and electric guitars; in thin strips, it is used in basket weaving. Ashes are also used as a source of firewood. The leaves and bark have been used medicinally, and in folklore ash was thought to protect from snakebite. Manna ash (F. ornus), a species of southern Europe, is the source of a sugary extract collected by making cuts in the bark and gathering the exuding sap when dry.",
    "Description": "Usually deciduous trees or shrubs, the bark rough, vertically furrowed. Leaves opposite, decussate, usually odd-pinnately compound, with leaflets (1–) 5–11, with the leaflets ovate to obovate, pinnately veined, with secondary veins forming obscure loops, the apex rounded to acuminate, the base slightly asymmetrical or not, decurrent to rounded, the margin entire to serrate, with simple hairs and/or glandular, peltate scales, petiolate or sessile; stipules absent. Inflorescences in axillary clusters, borne on shoot of the previous season, or terminal, borne on the shoot of the current season. Flowers radially symmetrical, bisexual or unisexual (and then plants usually with staminate flowers on one plant and carpellate flowers on another), usually inconspicuous and wind-pollinated, but occasionally showy, insect-pollinated; the sepals usually four, fused, small; the petals usually absent, but sometimes present, two or four, distinct or slightly fused, and white, with two anthers, and two fused carpels, style single, the ovary superior. Fruit a samara, with variably developed elongated wing (Figure 7.6).",

    "Quote": "The Northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. (LotR 6: IX)",
    "Significance": "Barley was domesticated in the Middle East, in the region of the Fertile Crescent, at about the same time as wheat, about 10,000 years ago. Although barley is only rarely mentioned in J. R. R. Tolkien’s legendarium, we can safely assume that this economically important grain was widely cultivated in the Middle-earth of the Third Age, as it is today across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere because of its importance in brewing beer (see “Economic Uses”), as is clear from the reference to “1420 malt” in the preceding quote. One can easily imagine the conversation between Sam Gamgee and Ted Sandyman occurring over a few pints as they sat in a corner of The Green Dragon pub at Bywater (Figure 7.7) discussing trouble on the borders of the Shire. And beer is frequently mentioned in The Lord of the Rings, as illustrated in the following few examples (listed in order of their occurrence). When Frodo and his three friends had dinner at the home of Farmer Maggot, there “was beer in plenty … beside much other solid farmhouse fare” (LotR 1: IV), and when they reached the Prancing Pony in Bree, Sam’s misgivings relating to his being outside the Shire were “much relieved by the excellence of the beer” (LotR 1: IX). When Merry and Pippin dine with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli at the ruined entrance to Isengard, Merry asked if they would like “wine or beer” (LotR 3: IX). When Gandalf and the four hobbits stopped again in Bree on their return journey, they attempted to explain that Strider was now the king; Butterbur imagined the king in his great castle, “drinking wine out of a golden cup” and was surprised when Sam disagreed, telling him that “he says your beer is always good” (LotR 4: VII). Finally, when they returned to the Shire, they found that the Bridge Inn had been torn down and were dismayed by the changes they found, especially the changes in how hobbits interact with each other—following petty rules and distrusting others instead of providing hospitality. Sam, in frustration, said “All right, all right! … I don’t want to hear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk instead” (LotR 4: VIII). Beer clearly is associated with hospitality, good conversation, and fellowship, reflecting Tolkien’s own enjoyment in sharing a few beers with his friends.",
    "Entymology": "“Barley” is derived from the Old English bærlic, which was originally an adjective (“of barley”; with bere as the corresponding noun), from Proto-Germanic *bariz (barley) + lic (like), and this probably derived from Proto-Indo-European *bhars- (bristle, point), which also gave rise to the word “bristle.” Interestingly, the word “barn” is derived from Old English bereærn (barley-house), as it is a place for the storage of grain. The scientific name Hordeum, the classical name for this plant, is related to the Latin horrere (to bristle), which is derived from Proto-Indo-European *ghers (to bristle), both of which are references to the elongate awns on the inflorescences of this important grain.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Barley is native to western Asia and northeastern Africa, was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent region (in the area of Israel and Jordan) about 10,000 years ago, and was then spread widely as a cultivated grain. Wild populations have a disarticulating inflorescence (so disperse their own seeds), whereas in cultivated barley the grains are held on the plant (so they can be easily harvested and thus rely on humans for distribution). Cultivated plants also have wider leaves, shorter stems, shorter inflorescence awns (bristles), and larger grains. The small flowers are wind-pollinated (cultivated plants are largely selfing), and the grains of wild populations are dispersed by animals because their elongated awns (bristles) become entangled in fur or feathers. Barley is common in grasslands, open woodlands, or various disturbed habitats. It is quite tolerant of poor soils and saline conditions.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Barley is economically important because the beer-brewing industry is mainly based on barley malt, which is made by soaking barley grains in water, allowing them to germinate (enzymatically converting their starch to sugars), and then rapidly kiln-drying them. In beer making, the malt is fermented to convert the sugars to ethyl alcohol (and then flavored with hops). The resulting alcoholic fluid (beer) can then be distilled, resulting in whiskey. However, barley is also used in making flat bread, and in soups and stews.",
    "Description": "Annual herbs, without rhizomes; stems erect, jointed, round in cross-section, hollow in internodal regions. Leaves alternate, two-ranked, simple and differentiated into a spreading blade, a sheath that closely encircles the stem, with its margins not fused, and with a membranaceous flap of tissue (the ligule) at the junction of the blade and sheath; the blade linear, flat, glabrous, but sometimes roughened. Inflorescences terminal, spikelike, with three spikelets per node, not breaking apart in cultivated plants, but falling apart (with spikelets falling in triplets) in wild populations. Flowers very tiny, arranged in spikelets, with only a single flower per spikelet; spikelets are arranged in two, four, or six rows along the axis, and each flower is surrounded by two bracts (a lemma and palea), some of these (the lemmas) often with elongated awns, with three sagittate anthers and two fused carpels; the ovary superior; the two stigmas plumose. Fruit a large plump grain, usually tightly enclosed by the bracts; nutritive tissue hard or mealy (Figure 7.7).",

    "Quote": "Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. (LotR 4: IV)",
    "Significance": "Sam had seen bay trees near the small lake by which they camped in Ithilien (see quote), and it was there he decided, in order to extend their food supply, that they should cook some fresh-caught game. Gollum cooperated, at least initially; he caught two small rabbits and fetched the water while Sam started a fire. Sam prepared to stew the rabbits in his camping pans. He had a precious bit of salt (from his pack), but he asked Gollum to bring him a “few bay-leaves, some thyme [Thymus vulgaris] and sage [Salvia officinalis]” before the water boiled. By that point, Gollum had had enough: he did not like the idea of cooking the rabbits, and he refused to look for herbs, stating that “Sméagol doesn’t like smelly leaves” (LotR 4: IV). So Sam had to gather the fragrant herbs for the stew himself. He found them close by, “not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still sleeping.” After Frodo awoke, the two ate the stew together, along with a bit of the Elvish waybread, sharing their single fork and spoon. After what they had experienced, it was like a feast. It is through such actions, even the little things like gathering bay leaves, that Sam expressed his love for his master and friend, Frodo. Even such small actions contributed to the success of the quest.",
    "Entymology": "The English common name “bay,” for the tree Laurus nobilis, is derived from the late Middle English baye (or baie), originally referring only to the berrylike fruits of this tree, but from the 1520s extended to the tree itself. The Middle English word was derived from the Old English beg (berry), but was conflated with Old French, baie (berry), which was derived from Latin, baca (berry). The scientific name Laurus is the classical name for this tree, and from this is derived the English word “laurel,” which is applied to L. nobilis (the true bay) and related species, such as the California bay (Umbellularia californica), red bay (Persea borbonia), and swamp bay (P. palustris). Laurus perhaps is etymologically related to the Greek daphne (meaning laurel). In Greek mythology, Daphne was a dryad (and daughter of the river god Peneus) who was amorously pursued by the god Apollo; she was turned into a bay tree to be safe from Apollo, and, as a result, he sadly wore a laurel wreath in her memory. Such wreaths became symbolic of what he embodied—especially victory and high achievement.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Laurus, a genus of only two species (L. nobilis and L. azorica), has a scattered distribution in the Mediterranean region and also occurs in the Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands. Bays grow in remnant patches of evergreen forest and scrub. Their flowers produce nectar and are pollinated by insects (especially bees); their fleshy fruits (drupes) are bird dispersed.",
    "Economic_Uses": "The major use of bay leaves is as a flavoring agent in food preparation, especially in soups and stocks. The leaves contain fragrant essential oils, especially 1,8-cineole, along with other terpenes and sesquiterpenes, that are stored in specialized spherical cells in the leaf tissue—thus, the leaves are minutely pellucid dotted when held up to the light. The leaves of related species of the laurel family (Lauraceae), such as California bay, red bay, and swamp bay, are used similarly. Laurus nobilis (the true bay, sweet bay, or bay laurel) is also used as an ornamental evergreen tree.",
    "Description": "Evergreen trees or shrubs, the branches with or without simple hairs, the bark more or less smooth, gray. Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, simple, ovate to slightly obovate, pinnately veined, the secondary veins forming loops, the apex acute to slightly acuminate, the base cuneate to acute, the margin entire, often undulate, with or without a few hairs beneath, shortly petiolate; stipules absent. Inflorescences axillary, in reduced cymes. Flowers radially symmetrical, unisexual (and the plants with the staminate and carpellate flowers on different plants), the perianth of four petaloid, white tepals, these distinct; the stamens in staminate flowers, 8–12, distinct, each stamen usually with two nectar-producing glands; its anther opening by two flaps, to which the yellow, sticky pollen adheres and, in carpellate flowers, reduced to 2–4 sterile structures (staminodes). The carpel one in the carpellate flowers, with a single style, the ovary superior. Fruit an ellipsoidal, black drupe, with a single pit.",

    "Quote": "The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves. (Hobbit VIII)",
    "Significance": "Usnea is the only lichen mentioned in J. R. R. Tolkien’s writings, but it is included not only in his early works (The Lay of the Children of Húrin and The Hobbit) but also in The Lord of the Rings and contributes to the imagery surrounding several important events in the legendarium, as seen in the introductory quotation from The Hobbit, from the second sentence of the chapter “Flies and Spiders.” Gandalf had just left, and Bilbo and the dwarves were about to enter Mirkwood, following the elven path. The Forest Gate is described as archlike, formed by two gigantic trees leaning against each other, and these trees are “strangled with ivy and hung with lichen” and bear only a few old, damaged leaves. Here we see two distinctive characteristics of Usnea: first, its preference for sickly, dead, or dying trees that have fewer leaves and thus a more open canopy, allowing more sunlight to reach the lichens; and, second, its characteristic epiphytic and hanging habit—that is, it almost always grows on trees or shrubs on which it forms a much-branched system of often pendulous, pale gray to yellowish branchlets (Figure 7.8). This growth form is so characteristic of Usnea, a fruticose lichen (i.e., one that has a branched, miniature, shrubby or treelike form), that the species of this genus are called beard lichens (or old man’s beards) because their hanging branches look a graying beard. These common names are alluded to by Tolkien elsewhere, as when Merry and Pippen entered Fangorn forest (Figure 7.8) and saw “great trailing beards of lichen hung from” huge branches (LotR 3: III), and Pippen, picking up on the old feeling of the forest, exclaimed—“Look at all those weeping, trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen!” (LotR 3: IV). These descriptions perfectly match the appearance of many species of Usnea, which are widespread and diverse in Europe (with more than 30 species occurring there) and thus would have been very familiar to Tolkien. Usnea seems to have been as common in Middle-earth, and it adds to our mental image of—and gives a certain foreboding quality to—the great forests of Mirkwood and Fangorn. This expectation of evil is expressed most clearly in the very similar description of the forest gateway where the orc trail from Thangorodrim entered Taur-nu-Fuin: the Forest-Beneath-Night, so named because it was filled with terror and dark-enchantment by Morgoth. We read in The Lay of the Children of Húrin that Beleg and Gwindor saw\n\n﻿[A]‌n archway opened. By ancient trunks it was framed darkly, that in far-off days the lightning felled, now leaning gaunt their lichen-leprous limbs uprooted. (Lays I: lines 936–939) Again, we see the image of ancient dead trees covered with beard lichens. Their presence is described as “leprous” because of their gray-green to yellow-green color, but this term is also appropriate given that Taur-nu-Fuin itself is diseased and distorted by the evil actions of Morgoth. This forest, located in Dorthonion north of Beleriand in the First Age, was much more perilous than either Fangorn or Mirkwood. Yet it was here that Beleg found Gwindor and rescued Túrin (see SILM 21).",
    "Entymology": "The word “beard” is derived from Old English beard, and that from West Germanic *barthaz, which was derived from Proto-Endo-European *bhardh-a- (beard). The English word “lichen” is derived from Latin lichen, and Greek leichen, probably from leichein (to lick), and this word was used originally for liverworts. The scientific generic name Usnea is derived from the Arabic usna, meaning “moss.”",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "The beard lichens (often also called old man’s beard or woman’s long hair) are members of the large (more than 500 species) and very widely distributed genus Usnea, which is common in Europe (with more than 30 species occurring there) and North America (ca. 80 species) as well as elsewhere, from the arctic to the tropics. Lichens are not a single organism; instead, each lichen is an integration of two very different species: a fungus and a photosynthetic organism (either a cyanobacterium or a green alga) that interact in a more or less mutually beneficial relationship. In the case of Usnea, the fungal partner is an ascomycete (i.e., a sac fungus, a large group that, in reproduction, produce their sexually reproductive spores in an elongated sac, or ascus; the group also contains the cup fungi and morels), and the algal partner is a green alga (i.e., a chlorophyte, probably species of Trebouxia). Species of Usnea are distinctive in that they look like tiny erect to pendant, well-branched trees, and they commonly grow on the trunks and branches of trees, especially ones with a sparse crown, as in trees that are unhealthy or dying. Usnea is not a parasite and it does not harm the trees on which it grows, but its growth is favored by the loss of a leafy tree canopy because this allows more sunlight to penetrate into the crown, thus providing more light for the algal component of the lichen. Usnea is a good indicator of air quality because it is quite sensitive to air pollution. Their spores and vegetative propagules are dispersed by wind.",
    "Economic_Uses": "The beard lichens are very useful medicinally because they contain usnic acid, which is an antibiotic. They are used in treating bacterial skin infections and are a component in some cosmetics and deodorants. They also have been used in making dyes and are an important wildlife food (and also provide nest materials for many birds).",
    "Description": "Fruticose (i.e., well-branched and shrubby) lichen, pendent to erect, yellow-green to gray-green, occasionally reddish, with the branches round to angular and having a central cartilaginous cord (of supporting tissue); the outer layer of each branch (i.e., the cortex) thin to thick, sometimes falling away, often with circular cracks around stem (so stem appearing segmented) and the branch surface smooth or roughened (because of tiny bumps, warts, or small, spiny side branches). Commonly with rounded mounds or depressed regions containing soredia (i.e., globose vegetative reproductive propagules consisting of one or a few algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments), and these often intermixed with isidia (i.e., small outgrowths of the lichen containing both algal cells and fungal filaments, which can break off and serve as propagules). The reproductive structures (producing the sacs, asci, bearing reproductive spores) cup- or disk-shaped; the spores colorless, ellipsoid, eight per ascus. Usnic acid present (Figure 7.8).",

    "Quote": "They bore back Beren Camlost son of Barahir upon a bier of branches with Huan the wolfhound at his side; and night fell ere they returned to Menegroth. At the feet of Hírilorn the great beech Lúthien met them walking slow, and some bore torches beside the bier. (SILM 19)",
    "Significance": "Tolkien clearly loved beech trees; they are mentioned frequently in his works, occur commonly in the forests of Middle-earth, and are connected with central aspects of his legendarium. Beeches are mentioned several times in The Hobbit. They are common in parts of Mirkwood, and “great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream” (Hobbit IX) along the Forest River, by the bridge to Thranduil’s halls, as seen in the illustration “The Elvenking’s Gate” (see fig. 121 in W. G. Hammond and C. Scull’s, 1995, J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator; and also “Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raftelves,” fig. 124 in the same reference; these are also reproduced in Hammond and Scull’s The Art of the Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien). Outside of poetry and song, in The Lord of the Rings, our first detailed description of beech comes when Sam awoke in Ithilien (after his and Frodo’s rescue by the eagles Gwaihir, Landroval, and Meneldor) and found that “he was lying on some soft bed, but over him gently swayed wide beechen boughs, and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered, green and gold” (LotR 6: IV). In this passage, Tolkien beautifully captures the golden-green of their newly emerged, translucent leaves. We have to turn to The Silmarillion for a description of their striking trunks: stout, tall, and high-branched, with smooth, thin, and silver-gray bark. The forests of Neldoreth and Brethil, occupying the northern and western portions of Doriath where Thingol and Melian dwelt, were dominated by beeches intermixed with oaks (Quercus spp.), elms (Ulmus spp.), and horse-chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum), and, in their hidden halls, the cave-chambers were supported by pillars carved in the likeness of great beeches. Hírilorn, the greatest of all the beech trees of Neldoreth, grew near the gates of Menegroth and “it had three, trunks, equal in girth, smooth in rind, and exceeding tall” (SILM 19). According to The Lays of Beleriand, majestic beeches, with gray trunks and golden-russet leaves, also grew around the beautiful and hallowed pools of Irvin, where Túrin, late in the year, was healed of his madness following the death of Beleg. However, they are most closely tied to the story of Lúthien and Beren, who first met in the beech-forest of Neldoreth and later walked there, “under mighty beeches silken-skinned, and sang of love that still shall be, though earth be foundered under sea” (Lays III: lines 3222–3226). Turning to the quote that introduces this section, under the great Hírilorn in which Lúthien had been imprisoned by her father, we see Beren, near death, but having recovered the Silmaril (Figure 7.9). It is here that Lúthien embraces and kisses him, asking him to await her beyond the Western Sea. In reading The Silmarillion, we begin to see beech trees, and the entire natural world, in a new way: the woods and meadows of our own world are transformed—and we hear the glorious music of the Ainur (see Bernthal, 2014).",
    "Entymology": "The English name “beech” was derived through Old English béce, from Proto-Germanic *bokjon, and Proto-Indo-European *bhagos, meaning “beech tree,” and it is related to the Latin fagus (beech) and Greek phagos (edible oak). The word “book” possibly is derived from the same Proto-Indo-European word, which may relate to the early use by Germanic peoples of beechwood tablets as writing material. The Quenya name of beech is feren or fernë (pl. ferni), but this was replaced in Beleriand by breth (mast) and later brethil (beech, as seen in the name: Forest of Brethil)—which should not be confused with the Sindarin word brethil, which means “birch.” Even more confusingly, in Thingol’s kingdom, the name for beech was neldor, based on the prefix nel- (meaning three), and this is a reference to the great beech of Thingol with three trunks.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Beeches belong to the genus Fagus, a group of 10 species distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in mesic, broad-leaved, and temperate to subtropical forests. American beech (Fagus grandifolia) is widespread in eastern North America, while European beech (F. sylvatica) occurs widely across Europe, and oriental beech (F. orientalis) grows from Bulgaria across Turkey to northern Iran. Finally, seven species occur in eastern Asia. Species of beech are distinguished by characters of leaf shape, form of the margin, variation in pubescence, and in the form of the scaly cupule (which surrounds the two triangular nuts). Their rather inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and their triangular nuts, within a spiny four-valved cupule, are eaten and dispersed by birds and mammals.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Beech trees are important ornamentals; they provide shade trees in urban environments, and these trees are visually striking because of their thin, smooth, silver-gray bark and the beautiful yellow color of their leaves in autumn. They are important timber trees; the wood is heavy, hard, and strong, and is used in flooring, veneer, furniture, and musical instruments. The nuts are edible (at least in small quantities), and the trees provide food to a variety of wildlife. The smooth bark seems hard for people to resist using as a poster for writing, and in urban parks initials are frequently seen carved into beech trunks.",
    "Description": "Tardily deciduous trees, often high-branched, with the trunks stout and tall, covered with smooth, thin, and silver-gray bark. Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, simple, ovate to elliptic, pinnately veined, with secondary veins more or less parallel, running into the leaf margin; the apex acute to acuminate, the base acute to obtuse or cuneate, the margin crenate (without distinct teeth) to obscurely or clearly serrate, with or without unicellular hairs, occasionally also glandular, petiolate; stipules present. Flowers inconspicuous, radially symmetrical, unisexual (with the staminate and carpellate flowers borne on the same plant), with an inconspicuous perianth of usually six tepals; the staminate inflorescences axillary, dangling, globose clusters of numerous flowers, the carpellate inflorescences in leaf axils, two-flowered, surrounded by a four-valved cupule (= cuplike structure); staminate flowers each with six to many stamens; carpellate flowers with three fused carpels, with three styles, the ovary inferior. Fruits three-angled, paired nuts borne in a four-valved, prickly cupule (Figure 7.9).",

    "Quote": "As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. (LotR 1: XII)",
    "Significance": "The names “bilberry” and “whortleberry” are applied to Vaccinium myrtillus but are also given to several related species, especially V. uliginosum. Both are low, rhizomatous shrubs (reaching only around a half meter in height) and occur across northern and central Europe in heaths, moors, thickets, and woods on acidic soils. J. R. R. Tolkien used both names and was most likely referring to V. myrtillus, which is the more widespread species, but V. uliginosum cannot be ruled out. Vaccinium myrtillus has leaves that are serrate (i.e., sharply saw-toothed) along the margin and acute at the apex and twigs that are angled, whereas V. uliginosum has leaves that are entire (i.e., smooth, without teeth) along the margin and obtuse at the apex and twigs that are terete. Perhaps he had both of these common European species in mind. The sole occurrence of the name “bilberry” in The Lord of the Rings occurs in the chapter “Flight to the Ford.” Aragorn was leading the four hobbits through the Trollshaws, along the East-West road, attempting to escape the Black Riders and making toward Rivendell. After they had heard the sound of hoofs behind them, they scrambled off the road “up into the deep heather [Calluna vulgaris] and bilberry brushwood” (LotR 1: XII) to hide (Figure 7.10; see also entry for Hazels, and entry for Heather, Figure 7.33). Much later, near a stream that joined the Silverlode, shortly after the Fellowship had escaped from Moria, they rested in a dell and “about it stood fir-trees [Abies alba], short and bent, and its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue [Asplenium scolopendrium] and shrubs of whortle-berry” (LotR 2: VI). It was here that Aragorn gently removed Frodo’s jacket and tunic, discovered his mithril corslet, and treated the wound he had received from the orc chieftain. Sam and Frodo also encountered “a thick growth of gorse [Ulex europaeus] and whortleberry” (LotR 4: VII) shortly before they rested on their journey to the Cross-roads. Clearly, whortleberry was common in open, acidic habitats of Middle-earth, as it and related shrubby species of Vaccinium are in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere today. Not surprisingly, given its latitude, these shrubs also occurred in Beleriand during the First Age, and they are mentioned in the unfinished Of Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin. As Voronwë led Tuor to the Hidden Kingdom, they encountered a company of orcs encamped on the highway leading north to Tol Sirion from the Crossings of Teglin. Trusting in the mantle of Ulmo, they crossed the road and at once heard a wild cry—the orc watchers had heard them, although they were not seen. Desperately, Tuor “stumbled and crept forward with Voronwë at his side, up a long slope deep in whin and whortleberry among knots of rowan and low birch” (UT 1: I). They hid beneath a large boulder, panting “like tired foxes” and the sounds of the searching orcs slowly grew faint. They had escaped capture and soon afterward would cross the Ford of Brithiach and approach the Encircling Mountains that protected the realm of Turgon. This close encounter is presented in beautiful detail, and the plants—whortleberry (V. myrtillus), whin (Ulex europaeus), forming low thickets with scattered birch (Betula pendula) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia)—allow us to picture it clearly.",
    "Entymology": "The English name “bilberry” is of Scandinavian origin, as seen in its similarity to the Danish bøllebær (literally meaning ball-berry) from the Old Norse bollr. “Whortleberry” is a dialectal variant of “hurtleberry,: from Middle English hurtilberye, the first element coming from Old English horte. Vaccinium apparently was the classical name of bilberry, and the word is derived from bacca, meaning “berry,” a reference to the characteristic fruits of these shrubs.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Species of the genus Vaccinium (i.e., the blueberries, cranberries, bilberries, and their relatives) are widely distributed from arctic to tropical regions; the genus is large, containing from 150 to as many as 500 species, the variation in number due to the fact that the group is an artificial assemblage, delimited arbitrarily from many similar (and related) plants such as Gaylussacia (huckleberries), Agapetes (diverse in the Indomalesian region, many with showy red flowers), and many other genera (e.g., Cavendishia, Macleania, Satyria) of the Andean region. The genus is, therefore, of uncertain delimitation. Blueberries are also botanically difficult at the species level as a result of hybridization and polyploidy (i.e., genome duplication) or merely because they grow in difficult-to-access tropical montane regions and are thus poorly collected and understood. The bilberry or whortleberry (V. myrtillus, but the common names are inconsistently applied and the same names are used for the related V. uliginosum) is widely distributed, occurring across Europe and northern Asia and also growing in the mountains of western North America. Vaccinium uliginosum has a boreal distribution, growing across northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Blueberries occur in numerous plant communities (e.g., bogs, swamps, wet shorelines, taiga, deciduous or coniferous forests, tundra, muskegs, alpine thickets and meadows, heaths, and moors) and are usually restricted to acidic soils. The north temperate species of Vaccinium are distinguished by characters such as stature, surface texture, and angularity of the twigs; whether the leaves are deciduous or evergreen; their shape, size, coloration, pubescence (hairs simple, unicellular, nonglandular hairs or multicellular, gland-headed), and margin (entire vs. variously toothed); whether or not the calyx is articulated from the floral pedicel; shape of the corolla; number of petals and the extent of their fusion; whether the stamens stick out from or are enclosed within the corolla; presence or absence of paired appendages on the anthers; and the color of the berries and number of seed-containing cavities (locules) within them. The usually white flowers function in an inverted position, like downward oriented bells or urns, and attract various bees, with nectar and pollen being the rewards. The pedicels curve upward after pollination so the blue, blue-black, or red berries develop in an erect position in which they are more visible to the dispersal agents: many different birds and mammals.",
    "Economic_Uses": "Blueberries are widely cultivated for their edible fruits, mainly cultivars of the highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum) but to a lesser extent also the sweet lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium); the fruits of many wild populations of these species and many others are also flavorful and gathered. In addition, the cranberries (especially V. macrocarpon, but also V. oxycoccos) are economically important crops. The fruits of bilberry or whortleberry (V. myrtillus) are much gathered in Europe for use as fresh fruit, in pies and jams, or for wine-making. We note that V. myrtillus is a member of Vaccinium sect. Myrtillus, a group that has flowers borne singly in the axils of the lowermost leaves; these flowers have pedicels that are not articulated with the calyx tube, stamens each with paired appendages, and fruits (in cross-section) with five seed-containing locules. The economically important highbush blueberry (and its lowbush relatives) are in sect. Cyanococcus, with flowers in clusters, having pedicels articulated with the calyx tube and stamens lacking paired appendages, and berries seemingly with 10 seed-containing locules. Finally, a few blueberry species are used as ornamentals.",
    "Description": "The arctic to temperate species are evergreen or deciduous, often rhizomatous shrubs, lianas, or small trees, with simple, nonglandular and/or gland-headed hairs. Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, simple, ovate to obovate, pinnately veined, the secondary veins forming loops, the apex acute to acuminate to rounded, the base acute or cuneate to rounded, the margin entire to serrate; stipules absent. Inflorescences axillary or terminal, short to elongate racemes or reduced to a solitary flower. Flowers radially symmetrical, bisexual, the sepals 4–5, slightly fused; the petals 4–5, usually strongly fused and forming a cylindrical, globose, urn-shaped, or less commonly bell-shaped corolla, white or greenish to pink; the stamens 8–10, their anthers with or without a pair of projections (awns or spurs), opening by pores, and each pore at the apex of a short to elongate tube; and 4–5 fused carpels, the style elongate, with truncate to capitate stigma, the ovary inferior. Fruit a blue, purple, black, or red berry with an apical “crown” formed by the persistent calyx, with few to numerous small seeds (Figure 7.10).",

    "Quote": "The next day at the hour of sunset Aragorn walked alone in the woods, and his heart was high within him; and he sang, for he was full of hope and the world was fair. And suddenly even as he sang he saw a maiden walking on a greensward among the white stems of the birches; and he halted amazed, thinking that he had strayed into a dream. (LotR Appendix A: I (v))",
    "Significance": "Birches are widely distributed in Middle-earth and are therefore frequently referenced in J. R. R. Tolkien’s writings. Their first mention is in the Green Hill Country of the Shire, on the night that Frodo, Sam, and Pippin began their journey to Rivendell, and their branches, above the heads of the hobbits, made “a black net against the pale sky” (LotR 1: III), reminding us that we are in “tree-tangled Middle-earth” (see the song to Elbereth, LotR 2: I, and discussion in T. Shippey’s, 2002, J. R. R. Tolkien: Author of the Century). They are last mentioned in the quote cited, which describes the first meeting of Aragorn and Arwen, occurring at sunset in a white birch forest in Rivendell. Aragorn had been told of his lineage only the day before and was singing the part of the Lay of Lúthien that tells of the meeting of Lúthien and Beren in the beech forest of Neldoreth, and, for a moment, thinking that she was Lúthien Tinúviel, he called out to her “even as Beren had done in the Elder Days.” The emphasis here, perhaps, is on the hope for the renewal and purification of Middle-earth, expressed in the association of Arwen and the white trunks of the birches, even though many years of darkness and struggle remained. The smooth bark characteristic of birches is reflected in the name, Skinbark, a birchlike ent, who lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard and had been wounded by Saruman’s orcs. Many of his tree-herds also had been destroyed, and Treebeard told Merry and Pippin that in response “he has gone up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best” (LotR 3: IV). A white birch forest also surrounded the open, grassy summit of the Hill of Anwar (= Halifirien), the holy mountain in the Ered Nimrais (= White Mountains) where Elendil was once buried. Their beautiful trunks, surrounded by silence, added to the awe and feeling of protection of any who visited the place (see UT 3: II; Watts, 2007). Birches are also a striking element in the landscape of Beleriand and play an important role in the narrative of The Silmarillion. For example, with the aid of Círdan, Eärendil built Vingilot, the ship that would carry him to Valinor (Figure 7.11), and its timbers were “hewn in the birchwoods of Nimbrethil” (SILM 24; also alluded to in Bilbo’s poem in LotR 2: I). We are told that on the high ridges of Amon Rȗdh grew “knots of birch, rowan [Sorbus aucuparia] and ancient thorn trees” (Crataegus spp.; CoH VII), and birches grew about a clear pool near the entrance to Mȋm’s cave. Birches also grew around the beautiful lake, Tarn Aeluin, surrounded by wild heaths in the highlands, where Barahir and his 11 companions (one of whom was Barahir’s son Beren) camped, hiding from Morgoth after the ruin of Dorthonion (as recorded in Lays IV: lines 190–198). White birches are beautifully illustrated in Ted Nasmith’s painting of Nienor being carried to Ephel Brandir by the men of Brethil (opposite p. 224 in the illustrated Silmarillion). Finally, although birches are not mentioned in The Hobbit, Tolkien’s beautiful color illustration “Rivendell” clearly shows a silver birch (Betula pendula) in the right foreground.",
    "Entymology": "The English name “birch” comes from the Old English, bierce or birce, and is of Germanic origin, derived from the Proto-Indo-European *bhergo, from the root *bhereg-, meaning to shine or gleam, in reference to the smooth, shiny, and often white bark of many species of birch. The Latin name, Betula, is derived from Gaulish betu, referring to bitumen, because a tarlike substance can be extracted from the bark of these trees. The Sindarin word brethil means silver birch and was the most commonly used name for these trees in the First through the Third Ages; nim is Sindarin for white, and thus Nimbrethil means “white birch” and is also the name of the birchwoods in Arvernien. Giraudeau (2011) lists chwind and whinn as other Sindarin names for birches. The Quenya word for birch may be silwin and/or hwindë.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Birches belong to the genus Betula, a group of ca. 40 species distributed broadly across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The silver birch (B. pendula) and downy birch (B. pubescens) are widespread in Europe, while paper birch (B. papyrifera) occurs across cool temperate to boreal North America. Gray birch (B. populifolia), river birch (B. nigra), sweet birch (B. lenta), and yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) are common trees in eastern North America, and water birch (B. occidentalis) is widespread across western North America. Numerous species (e.g., B. chinensis, B. dahurica, and B. platyphylla) occur in eastern Asia. Leaf form, bark, and characteristics of the fruiting catkins are often useful in identification, but species are often difficult to distinguish as a result of hybridization. Birches grow in cool, moist",
    "Economic_Uses": "The wood is used in veneers and to make furniture, tool handles, spools, toothpicks, baskets, or woodpulp for paper, and the twigs are used to make brooms; the waterproof bark of some species was once used in making canoes and tepee covers, provided writing material, and is also useful tinder. The bark can be processed to release birch-tar, which was once widely used as an adhesive and disinfectant and is still used medicinally and in leather processing. The sap of some species can be processed to make birch syrup or beer. Many species are popular ornamental trees because of their striking bark (smooth, peeling, and often white, gray, or yellowish). Birches are rapidly growing plants and are typically pioneer species, colonizing disturbed and/or open habitats. They are also ecologically important in providing browse for wildlife.",
    "Description": "Deciduous trees or shrubs, the bark more or less smooth, often peeling, dark brown, yellow to chalky white, with dark, often horizontal lenticels, and branches sometimes with the taste or odor of wintergreen. Leaves alternate, more or less two-ranked, simple, ovate to elliptic, pinnately veined, with secondary veins running into the teeth; the apex acuminate or acute to rounded, the base acute or cuneate to rounded or cordate, the margin usually double serrate (i.e., with small and large teeth) with variably developed simple and gland-headed hairs, petiolate; stipules present. Flowers inconspicuous, radially symmetrical, unisexual, lacking a perianth, in groups of three associated with each three-lobed, bract complex, densely clustered in dangling, elongate, staminate catkins (formed in the previous growing season, exposed in winter) and erect, ovoid to cylindric, carpellate catkins (with staminate and carpellate catkins on the same plant); staminate flowers each with two or three stamens, and the filament of each stamen divided nearly to the base; carpellate flowers with two fused carpels, with two styles, the ovary nude (as the perianth is absent). Fruit a samara with two lateral, membranaceous wings (Figure 7.11).",

    "Quote": "They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this rate. (Hobbit IV)",
    "Significance": "Blackberries and raspberries are infrequently mentioned in Tolkien’s writings, although they were as widespread and common in Middle-earth (including Beleriand, in the First Age) as they are in Europe and throughout the Northern Hemisphere today. The evidence for this abundance is the much more frequent use of the alternative common name, “bramble” for these difficult plants, alluding to the fact that they often form tangled, almost impenetrable thickets in disturbed or open habitats, which are especially difficult to walk through because of their sharp, straight to recurved prickles. When hiking, it is thus unpleasant to pass through areas where they are abundant, even though the fruits provide a nice treat (if in season!). Shortly after leaving Rivendell, Bilbo was somewhat dismayed at the slow progress they were making toward the Lonely Mountain (see quote) and wistfully thought that it would be blackberry season back in the Shire (Figure 7.12) before he and the dwarves even got to the eastern slopes of the Misty Mountains. It would be unlike hobbits to miss out on the pleasure of gathering wild blackberries, and, in The Lord of the Rings, the hobbits enjoyed a blackberry tart, among other delicious items, at the Prancing Pony in Bree. From The Hobbit we know that Bilbo kept raspberry jam in his larder! However, travelers in Middle-earth frequently encountered blackberries, as brambles, when traveling, and such encounters were usually unpleasant. Brambles are first mentioned when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are lost in the Old Forest, when they were led in the wrong direction by deep folds in the ground, which were “choked with brambles” (LotR 1: VI). These must have ripped at their clothing and scratched their arms and legs, adding to the misery of that hike. Brambles are often associated with disturbed habitats, and we see this aspect of their ecology when they are encountered in the vicinity of Isengard, where the trees had been felled and the landscape ravaged by Saruman, and most of the wizard’s valley “had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or clambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts housed” (LotR 3: VIII). They are sun-loving plants and are early successional; that is, they are among the early colonizers of disturbed habitats, assisting in the recovery of biodiversity and providing food and cover for wildlife. Likewise, as Gollum led Frodo and Sam up into the hills of Ithilien, as they approached the Cross-Roads they passed through habitats long impacted by environmentally destructive activities of Sauron—and they again encountered “thickets and wastes of brambles” (LotR 4: VII). However, we see this evidence of environmental damage most keenly within Mordor itself. When Frodo and Sam scrambled on the eastern slopes of the Ephel Duath they found themselves in a polluted and dying land. But it was not yet dead. In the valleys there were areas in which “low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great writhing, tangled brambles sprawled,” and the two remaining members of the quest certainly experienced their “hooked barbs that rent like knives” (LotR 6: II). Here, the plants were in a desperate struggle for life, living in a poisoned environment, and all plant life had become harsh and twisted as a result of this struggle, as clearly seen in the writhing brambles with their hooked barbs—almost the only plant still thriving there. Tolkien’s highlighting of brambles in such environments is quite traditional—weedy species of Rubus have long been associated with ecological degradation (see, for example, Isaiah 5:6, 7:23, 9:18, and 10:17). Blackberries/brambles thus present a remarkable contrast: the same plant that produces delicious berries (eliciting memories of summertime blackberry picking and also providing food for wildlife) also forms tangled, prickly thickets that especially flourish in habitats damaged by human activities (or, in Middle-earth, the activities of Maiar, such as Saruman or Sauron, who have left the path of wisdom).",
    "Entymology": "The name “blackberry” (a reference to the color of the fruits) is derived from Old English blacberian, from blæc (black) + berie (berry); the word berie is from Proto-Germanic *basjom, which is of unknown origin. The common name “bramble” goes back to the Old English bræmbel, from earlier bræmel, from Proto-Germanic *braemaz (thorny bush), from the Proto-Indo-European root *bh(e)rem- (to project, a point), presumably in reference to the sharp prickles characteristic of these plants. The name is now applied to various species of Rubus, but originally the name meant any thorny or prickly plant (Watts, 2007). Raspberry is derived from “raspis berry,” possibly from raspise, a sweet rose-colored wine (mid-fifteenth century), from Anglo-Latin vinum raspeys, and likely related to Medieval Latin raspecia, raspeium (raspberry). The scientific name Rubus is derived from the Latin, ruber (meaning red), in reference to the color of the mature fruits of some species (but others have fruits that are only red when immature and turn black at maturity). Pûg is the Sindarin word for blackberry, while in Quenya the name may be piucca.",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Blackberries (also brambles and raspberries, all species of the genus Rubus) are widely distributed but are especially diverse in the Northern Hemisphere; some species, however, also grow in the West Indies, Central and South America, Africa, the Pacific region, and Australia. The total number of species in the group is unknown and, in fact, difficult to determine because of extensive hybridization, polyploidy (i.e., chromosome doubling, etc.), and asexual reproduction, but it is likely somewhere between 250 and 700. Thirty-seven species (broadly delimited) are recognized in North America, north of Mexico, while around 75 species and species complexes have been recognized in Europe. The group is most diverse in Eastern Asia, and more than 200 species are known from China and nearly 40 from Japan. Species are distinguished by characters of their habit (stems erect or creeping, biennial or perennial, evergreen or deciduous), leaves (simple or compound, number and arrangement of leaflets, extent of lobing, leaflet shape and size, development of marginal teeth, form of the stipules), pubescence (development of both unicellular, nonglandular hairs, and multicellular, gland-headed hairs), armature (presence or absence of prickles, and variation in their form), flowers (color and size of the petals, number of carpels), and fruits (whether or not the cluster of drupelets separates from the receptacle, size and color of the cluster of drupelets). Blackberries grow in an exceptionally broad array of plant communities, including open woodlands, savannas, swamps, bogs or fens, prairies, meadows, in rocky or sandy habitats, lakeshores and stream banks, and various wet to dry disturbed habitats such as clearings and roadsides. Their showy flowers attract a variety of insects (especially flies, bees, wasps, butterflies, beetles), and the fleshy, black or red fruits are dispersed by birds and a few mammals (such as bears).",
    "Economic_Uses": "Blackberries and raspberries are economically important because of their flavorful, edible berries (actually, botanically speaking, clusters of drupelets), and the fruits are either cultivated or gathered from the wild, and eaten fresh or made into jams, pies, or beverages. The blackberries are those species in which the drupelets adhere to the receptacle, so when a fruit is picked the receptacle (tissue bearing the cluster of drupelets) is picked along with the drupelets. In contrast, in the raspberries, the mature cluster of drupelets falls free from the receptacle. This distinction, although used in distinguishing these two fruit conditions, does not reflect evolutionary relationships. Important raspberry species include R. idaeus (red raspberry) and R. occidentalis (black raspberry); many cultivated plants represent complex hybrids of these two and also other species. Popular prickleless blackberry cultivars have been derived from hybrids of R. ulmifolius (elm-leaf blackberry) and R. hastiformis, although many blackberries are gathered from wild species. A few species, such as R. odoratus (purple-flowering raspberry), are grown as ornamentals because of their large flowers. Finally, some species have been used medicinally (especially to alleviate labor pains).",
    "Description": "Perennial, herbs to subshrubs (or shrubs); stems erect, arching or creeping, and of two types: primocanes (each a biennial or perennial vegetative stem, prior to being sufficiently developed for flowering) and floricanes (each a biennial or perennial stem after it has begun flowering); hairs variably developed, some not glandular and others gland-headed; both stems and leaves often with sharp-pointed modified hairs (i.e., prickles), and these sparse to dense, erect to curved, weak to stout. Leaves evergreen or deciduous, alternate, spirally arranged, occasionally simple or more commonly variously compound (with 3–9 leaflets), lobed or unlobed; the leaves or leaflets variously shaped, with pinnate or palmate venation, the apex acute or acuminate to rounded; the base cordate to acute or cuneate (and asymmetrical in lateral leaflets); the margin crenate, dentate, or serrate, or doubly so; the lower surface without prickles or with prickles on midvein similar to those of the stem, without hairs or with unicellular, nonglandular hairs and/or multicellular, gland-headed hairs, the leaves petiolate. Stipules present, often adnate to the petiole, with the leaves of the primocanes often differing from those of the floricanes. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, the flowers numerous to few, in cymes or reduced to a solitary flower. Flowers usually bisexual, radially symmetrical, more or less erect, with a flat floral cup (= hypanthium) bearing five sepals, five distinct white to pink or magenta petals, and numerous stamens; the carpels usually numerous, distinct, and with or without hairs; the ovaries superior, each with a slender to distally thickened style. Fruit a cluster of drupelets, these golden yellow to red or black, globose to cylindric, and each with a single small, hard pit (Figure 7.12).",

    "Family": "Hay-scented Fern",
    "Quote": "She [Niënor] stood still a moment as in wonder, and then, in a swoon of utter weariness, she fell as one stricken down into a deep brake of fern. And there amid the old bracken and the swift fronds of spring she lay and slept, heedless of all. (CoH XV).",
    "Significance": "Bracken is larger than most temperate ferns and often forms dense stands (called brakes). As in most ferns, the young leaves are coiled, forming fiddleheads (or crosiers). Tolkien, as narrator, describes them as the “tight-curled fronds of spring” (LotR 3: XI) in the valley where Gandalf and his traveling companions camped after their confrontation with Saruman. Their stature is emphasized several times, as when, after escaping from the goblins, Bilbo and the dwarves hiked through the dense understory of a pine forest and found that “they were pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit’s head” (Hobbit VI) (Figure 7.13). In fact, the tendency of this tall fern to form dense stands means that it provides good cover, hiding Beleg “in bracken cowering … through the leaves peering” as he watched Túrin “as he tottered forward neath the whips of the Orcs” (Lays I: lines 1013–1016) when he passed in captivity through Taur-nu-Fuin, being taken by an orc company to Morgoth’s stronghold. The value of bracken as fragrant bedding material will be recognized by many hikers and backpackers, and we see this usage in Treebeard’s bed, which is described as “covered deep in dried grass and bracken” (LotR 3: IV). In a more tragic tale, Niënor, suffering from the effects of her encounter with the dragon Glaurung, collapsed and slept in a deep brake of fern (i.e., bracken thicket) near the forest of Brethil. She soon after was found by Túrin, on the very mound where the elf maiden Finduilas was buried.",
    "Entymology": "The English name “bracken” was derived from the Middle English, braken, a name of Scandinavian origin, and related to the Swedish, bräken, referring to a large fern, especially the plant now known under the scientific name Pteridium aquilinum. “Brake” (a shortened form of bracken) is also of Middle English origin, referring both to this large and often weedy fern and to an open area overgrown with ferns and shrubs. Pteridium is derived from the Greek, pteridion, a diminutive of pteris, meaning fern. The specific epithet aquilinum is derived from the Latin aquila, eagle, possibly an imaginative allusion to its leaves, appearing like eagle’s wings, or to the pattern of vascular bundles of the petiole that, when cut in cross-section, appear as a two-headed spread eagle (but see also Vickery, 1995).",
    "Destribution_Ecology": "Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) occurs almost worldwide and is morphologically variable (divided into two subspecies and 12 varieties, a few of which are sometimes recognized as distinct species). It grows in the understory of dry to moist woods or in open areas and often invades pastures, fields, and roadsides, forming large colonies due to its aggressive rhizomatous growth, suppression of germination of other species, and resistance to fires (due to its deeply buried system of rhizomes).",
    "Economic_Uses": "In many regions bracken is a common weed of pastures, and its presence is especially problematic because it is toxic to both animals and humans if eaten. Ironically, the young emerging leaves—fiddleheads—were once widely consumed, especially in Eastern Asian cultures, but they contain thiaminase and other mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds. The plant was once used as roofing thatch, as a quick fuel source, as a source of potash (used in soap-making and the glass industry), and in tanning leather. It is still used as a source of a yellow dye, and the dried leaves provide bedding for livestock. Ecologically, bracken is important in providing cover for wildlife.",
    "Description": "Herbaceous, moderate-sized to large fern, emitting a pleasant, somewhat sweet fragrance, with underground, slender, and long-creeping rhizomes that lack scales. Leaves (or fronds), alternate, widely spaced, emerging individually from the soil, the blade triangular in shape, compound, divided pinnately two to three times, the ultimate segments pinnately lobed, some divisions (pinnae) with nectar glands at the base; the margins entire, revolute, the lower surface with usually sparse to dense hairs; the petiole elongate, grooved on the upper surface, glabrous or with short hairs. Spore-bearing regions (i.e., the sori) on the underside of the leaf, elongated, positioned along the leaf margin, covered when young by an outer false indusium (the inrolled leaf margin) and an inner true indusium (i.e., an elongate flap). Spores borne in stalked, globose containers (sporangia) that open by means of a vertical annulus (line of thick-walled cells) that is interrupted by the stalk and that curves back when dry, ripping open the sporangium and dispersing the tiny spores (Figure 7.13).",
