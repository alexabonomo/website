brain storming process about visualizing text. A lot of questions. 

Data Set: Flora of Middle Earth Field Guide 

Thoughts that I need to clear up:

.... Lord of the Rings? Is that too nerdy...

I also have a copy of Werner's Nomenclature of Color which is a historical text that is also easily able to be translated into an csv file, but I can imagine the level of visualization that is required with Flora of Middle Earth



I have been reading a lot about speculative design and there are many parallels to futurism and science fiction. Say I had a book that was a field guide to the fauna and flora of middle earth and I wanted the audience to able to catch how many times a certain plant appears in say rivendel... Is that possible?

Natural Language Processing Technique

Out of all of the options I found that https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise give the best options for parsing english langauge down to the grammar types. They also mention it's speed is amicable with small browsers. I am guessing this would be useful for future high graphics processing comes into play.


So I am having a few questions. How can you easily take text from a book and convert into an csv? I have the digital file that looks easily applicable to entering into a form. 

Interactions for Flora of Middle Earth 

A node diagram of Plant types. A tree linking to their common and latin names and descriptions.
When you click on a plant type, you can see how often the plant type is refered to in the text and in the movie ( http://www.ageofthering.com/atthemovies/)
sort through all of the figures and images using similarity to the plant it's location.

Here is inormation from a fellow design grad I am considering collaborating with for this project. Can you provide feedback on this?

Data Set: The text of each state's voter ID law (only 35 states have one)
Goal: To use voter ID laws as a data set; to figure out how the laws can be modeled in relationship to factors such as state's overarching political party affiliations, etc...
Chosen natural language processing techniques: 
Hapax Richness
TFIDF
NGRAMS
Briefly describe the views and interactions that your dashboard will contain:
Would like to highlight similarities and differences between the text of the laws
Would like to highlight complexity, repetition of the writing
Would like to highlight differences in writing style
Open to other ideas about what kinds of views and interactions would be interesting with this data set
