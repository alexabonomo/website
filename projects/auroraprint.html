        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Aurora Print was my first time tinkering with physical computing for a large scale installation. The idea started
            after watching Don Hertzfeldt’s A World of Tomorrow. The line “I opened up a gallery of anonymous memories” had
            become stuck in my mind and inspired me to create my own version. Vague but collosal memories accumulate when you
            start to acclimate to a new zone, or geographical area. I wanted to change perspective to the idea of sharing one's
            own memories. The structure hung from the ceiling all on the same x plane. But at different x and y planes forming
            an environment inn which you stare upward, thus an aurora state of memories.</p>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p>The project utilizes multiple facets of computational methods. A pulse sensor takes heartbeat input as a method of
            animating a still image. RGB channels, or the three channels of color often to decsribe color on the web are warped
            and shifted using GLSL Shaders. A projector uses madmapper to use syphon input to display a web page onto fabric
            hangings. For more implementation visit
