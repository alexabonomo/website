        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>I was invited to participate in a series at <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/field-of-view-storytelling"> The Exploratorium </a> about emergent new media technology for storytelling.
        My first dry summer after moving from the east coast, I was left nostalgic for rain. I created an environment that used the current number of people in the room to power a rainstorm. The more people in the room, the more calm the storm becomes encouraging people to gather around the structure almost like a beacon. A the bottom of the fabric are screen prints of native Californian plants printed in Kala Art Institute in Berkeley.</p>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p>Pitter patter is an iteration of the same projection methods used in Aurora Print but instead using larger panels of fabric. The input is coming from a kinect device that is tracking people in 3D space. A TSPS software was used as a library in a webpage that recorded number of people in the room and age or time in the space. Javascript is the main engine that powered the simulation of rain using processing. For more implementation visit <link href="#"></p>
        <h1>Futures</h1>
        <p>Natural sytems influence the trajectory of aesthetics. There is a beauty in data that cannot be decribed without a system of motion or environment. Numerical values, like a number of people in a space or time are immediate signifiers of a moment in place. This project enlightened my research into asking the question, "what is our data ecosystem?</p>
