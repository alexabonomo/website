        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>This started out as a small project at Gray Area foundation of the Arts Immersive showcase. This was a small inkling into a much larger independent research topic while making at UC Davis Center for Design and ViDi Labs. My first time "drawing" what playing the piano looked like in realtime felt magical. I thought if only I can make a journal of all of these captures. Then I'd have something worthwhile. </p>

        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p> Processing canvas sketch run by accelerometer data mapping xyz axis points. Mqtt on a local wifi server to send and recieve data and to implement wireless access to a wristband for portability. <link href="#"></p>
        <h1>Futures</h1>
        <p>The ideology of mapping has influenced emerging technology that we use every day. There are syneasthetic qualities in
            most of our everyday activity then mapped to a value of information. But the meaningfullness behind this is that
            this influences perceptual influences on anthropology and our ecological environment. </p>
