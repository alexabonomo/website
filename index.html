            <p>The Quantified Self is best described by Gary Wolf as “self-knowledge through
                numbers.” William James’ theory of the consciousness of the self and the study of coping
                inspires drawings that retell personal narratives at the same time reveal traces of the
                subtle emotion associated with intentional forgetting. Codex Endogenous is a project
                that reveals and visualizes the beauty and morphology of a “self” and its environment.
                Here, “codex” refers to a collection of pages stitched together, and “endogenous” is
                a term in cognitive neuroscience used to describe phenomena that is spontaneously
                generated from an individual’s internal state. Every day, quantifiable information about
                the self is produced; left unrevealed would leave the spirit of a self undiscovered. In
                this project, the self information is transformed into self-knowledge. Data is tracked
                throughout a day, categorized into implicit and explicit information, visualized as daily
                data drawings. Analogous to the practice of keeping a daily journal, Codex Endogenous
                is a digital journal in a screen-based format. It is composed of drawings that embody
                data representation of the quantified self in the context of environmental habituation
                including the intentional redaction of information rather forgotten.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Networks, emotion and behavior became a determining factor of interest for UC Davis' Annual Community
                Book Project centered around the idea of Joy. Theory of mind is the human phenomena that allows us to
                detect one another’s emotions.
                People were able to move around freely and watch trails of lines connect to nearby beings. Slowly the
                colors would layer on top of eachother and morph into new colors. Euclidian relationships acted as an
                abstract analogy to the social relationships we form</p>
            <p>First acccomplished hard coded blob detection with persistance process shot. Followed Daniel Shiffman's
                tutorial and integrsated it with my own design. Counts current blobs in the space and deletes blobs when
                they disappear.</p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p> Processing drew on to a canvas using spatial input from a kinect ir sensor. Within processing, the ir
                sensor took a bitmapped grid of pixels, mapped a retangle around the max distances on the x and y axis
                and calculated the center to draw a point, thus forming lines segments from one vector to the next. The
                bit map mirroring a person showed up as grey and the lines were colored by a spectrum class that
                preformed a function to iterate over the hsb spectrum. This resulted in trails of prismatic connections.

            <h2>Futures</h2>
            <p>The ideology of mapping has influenced emerging technology that we use every day. There are syneasthetic
                qualities in most of our everyday activity then mapped to a value of information. But the
                meaningfullness behind this is that this influences perceptual influences on anthropology and our
                ecological environment. </p>

            <h1 id="proj3">Pitter Patter</h1>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I was invited to participate in a series at <a
                    href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/field-of-view-storytelling"> The Exploratorium
                </a> about emergent new media technology for storytelling.
                My first dry summer after moving from the east coast, I was left nostalgic for rain. I created an
                environment that used the current number of people in the room to power a rainstorm. The more people in
                the room, the more calm the storm becomes encouraging people to gather around the structure almost like
                a beacon. A the bottom of the fabric are screen prints of native Californian plants printed in Kala Art
                Institute in Berkeley.</p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Pitter patter is an iteration of the same projection methods used in Aurora Print but instead using
                larger panels of fabric. The input is coming from a kinect device that is tracking people in 3D space. A
                TSPS software was used as a library in a webpage that recorded number of people in the room and age or
                time in the space. Javascript is the main engine that powered the simulation of rain using processing.

            <h2>Futures</h2>
            <p>Natural sytems influence the trajectory of aesthetics. There is a beauty in data that cannot be decribed
                without a system of motion or environment. Numerical values, like a number of people in a space or time
                are immediate signifiers of a moment in place. This project enlightened my research into asking the
                question, "what is our data ecosystem?</p>

            <h1 id="proj4">Sense</h1>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>This started out as a small project at Gray Area foundation of the Arts Immersive showcase. This was a
                small inkling into a much larger independent research topic while making at UC Davis Center for Design
                and ViDi Labs. My first time "drawing" what playing the piano looked like in realtime felt magical. I
                thought if only I can make a journal of all of these captures. Then I'd have something worthwhile. </p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p> Processing canvas sketch run by accelerometer data mapping xyz axis points. Mqtt on a local wifi server
                to send and recieve data and to implement wireless access to a wristband for portability. </p>
            <h2>Futures</h2>

            <h1 id="proj5">AuroraPrint</h1>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Aurora Print was my first time tinkering with physical computing for a large scale installation. The idea
                started
                after watching Don Hertzfeldt’s A World of Tomorrow. The line “I opened up a gallery of anonymous
                memories” had
                become stuck in my mind and inspired me to create my own version. Vague but collosal memories accumulate
                when you
                start to acclimate to a new zone, or geographical area. I wanted to change perspective to the idea of
                sharing one's
                own memories. The structure hung from the ceiling all on the same x plane. But at different x and y
                planes forming
                an environment inn which you stare upward, thus an aurora state of memories.</p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>The project utilizes multiple facets of computational methods. A pulse sensor takes heartbeat input as a
                method of
                animating a still image. RGB channels, or the three channels of color often to decsribe color on the web
                are warped
                and shifted using GLSL Shaders. A projector uses madmapper to use syphon input to display a web page
                onto fabric
                hangings.
