            <p>Alexa is a creative coder and design researcher who has spent her career programming mixed reality large-scale and screen-based data visualizations representing the "quantified self". Beginning in the Baltimore art scene, Alexa started a personal practice of meditational drawings and self-teaching herself code before moving to the Bay Area. She has exhibited work in and around San Francisco and East Bay including Kala Art Institute, Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, and the Exploratorium. Alexa has completed her research at UC Davis with a focus on data visualization and personal science. When she is not teaching a digital design course, she spends her time prototyping, experimental art practices, and building code. Alexa's current research consists of remodeling ways to shift conventional uses of common technologies that are meant for the high-functioning world to provide self-knowledge and self-care to individuals who are neurodivergent or have neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
